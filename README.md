# twitch-chat-overlay

Chrome/ium extension to have a twitch chat open anywhere.

This implementation is completely pragmatic, so no fancy code: we just get the job done.

If it isn't working, just [create an issue](https://github.com/lucianoratamero/twitch-chat-overlay/issues), contribute with a pull request or contact me at [luciano+chromeextensions@ratamero.com](mailto:luciano+chromeextensions@ratamero.com) and I'll publish it as soon as I can ;]
